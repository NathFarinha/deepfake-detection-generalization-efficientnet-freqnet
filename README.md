# deepfake-detection-generalization-efficientnet-freqnet
This repository presents a comprehensive comparison of deepfake detection models, focusing on their generalization capabilities. We evaluate two state-of-the-art architectures, EfficientNetB4 and FreqNet, to determine their effectiveness when facing unseen deepfake manipulation techniques.
